# Custom Comment Permissions

## Drupal module that provides additional permissions for comments

WARNING: the module overloads the "post comments" permission, so no one (except
user-1) is allowed to post comment after the module has been installed. You have
to configure the additional permissions first.

User should have the "post comments" permission in addition to the ones provided
by this module.

For the moment only "post" permissions are available.

There is no OG dependency, however, if OG is installed, additional OG-related
permissions are available.
